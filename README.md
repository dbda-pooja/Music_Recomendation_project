# Music_Recomendation_project

ABSTRACT
Music is one of the common languages that connects us all together and it has always been a major part of all our lives. For that first we downloaded data using python, performed ETL operations using spark and dump that data in MongoDB for recommendation system and visualization using PowerBI. We used Neighborhood Collaborative Filtering using the similarity metrics method to recommend more accurate songs to the user.

INTRODUCTION
In simple words, a recommendation system is any system that automatically
suggests content for website readers and users. These systems were evolved as
intelligent algorithms, which can generate results in the form of recommendations to
users.
[1] They require a large dataset and a fast-computing system that can perform analytics
on same within fraction of seconds.
[2] A variety of techniques have been proposed till today for performing recommendations. Recommendation system is defined as the computer program that helps the user
determine goods and content by predict the users rating of each item and presentation
them the substance that they would rate highly. There are different ways to approach
a recommendation system. They are basically divided into Content-based and Collaborative Filtering systems. In our project we are using Collaborative filtering.
1.1 Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering is based on customer’s behavior’s and past likes. It is used to make automatic predictions, filtering collecting preferences, interest of a user and taste information of many users. Collaborative filtering can be performed in two ways mainly, model-based and memory-based.
Music Recommendation System

Purpose
The objective of the problem is to recommend Songs. Clearly, we have to create a recommendation system here. Here we used Neighborhood Collaborative Filtering using the similarity metrics method.

Data Collection:
To create a Spotify recommendation system, we will be using a dataset that has been collected from Spotify. The dataset contains over 175,000 songs with over 19 features grouped by artist, year and genre. we will begin the task of building a music recommendation system with machine learning by importing the necessary Python libraries and dataset.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Python:
 Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language.
 Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object- oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.
 Python has a large and broad library and provides rich set of module and functions for rapid application development.

Apache Spark:
 Streaming Data - Apache Spark’s key use is its ability to process streaming data.  Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools used.  Interactive Analysis - Among Spark’s, most notable features are its capability for interactive analytics.

MongoDB:
 MongoDB’s defining features is its schema-less or non-relational data structure.  Traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools used.  MongoDB is the opportunity for horizontal scaling through sharding.

Machine Learning:
 Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
 Machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output.

PowerBI:
 Microsoft Power BI provides such tools that will let you visualize key data points accurately from various sources in a single dashboard.  Power BI takes input from various sources and provides that data in various contexts  Power BI helps businesses to check any kind of details to ensure that the business is running smoothly.

System Requirements
Hardware Requirements:
 Platform – windows 10
 RAM – 8 GB of RAM,
 A network connection for data recovering over network.

Software Requirements:
 Python 3
 Apache Spark
 MongoDB
 PowerBI
 Flask

Data Engineering and Analysis:
Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of
data collection and analysis. For all the work that data scientists do to answer questions using large sets of information, there have to be mechanisms for collecting and validating that information.
Data Cleaning:
Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting. After cleansing, a data set should be consistent with other similar data sets in the system. The inconsistencies detected or removed may have been originally caused by user entry
errors, by corruption in transmission or storage, or by different data dictionary definitions of similar entities in different stores. Data cleaning differs from data validation in that validation almost invariably means data is rejected from the system at entry and is performed at the time of entry, rather than on batches of data.
